		"lyrics": `Please be careful what you say
I may die this way
Be careful how your mouth pulled apart
I can see your lips, I don't wanna feel your heart

Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth
Slowly lie to me
Like I need you to do so I can hear you say
Something that sounds right

Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth

Please be careful what you say
'Cause if I split in two you will be to blame
'Cause I know nothing better and nothing worse
And how you twist your letters into words

Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth
Slowly lie to me
Like I need you to do so I can hear you say
Something that sounds right

Slowly lie to me
Like I need you to do when you tell the truth
And tell me what to believe, and tell me what to deny
And whisper into my ear till everything dark turns bright

Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth
Slowly lie to me
Like I need you to do so I can hear you say
Something that sounds right`

The sun was down and the tide was high
And as the wind picked up you softly said
"You've made a big mistake"

These weeks have been
Everything to me, I'm a fool for her
She looks to sea, "Darling, why pick me?
I'm not made for love"
You're not made for love

Well you've made a big mistake
You've made a big mistake
And when I think of all the things I've shared
Love must've got the best of me
'Cause I've found my place
But on the wind you said
"You've made a big mistake"

Three weeks that mean
Everything to me just flew by for her
She speaks down to me
"Darling, what do you think?
I'm not made for love"
You're not made for love

Well, you've made a big mistake
You've made a big mistake
Well, you've made a big mistake
You've made a big mistake
Well, you've made a big mistake
You've made a big mistake

When we were out on the beach that night
When we were out on the beach that night
When we were out on the beach that night
When we were out on the beach that night
