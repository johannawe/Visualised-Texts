Such a waste I'm waiting out in this space
Such a waste I'm waiting out in this
Such a waste I'm waiting out in this place

Ohhhh...you're waiting in my mind
Ohhhh your face is all I'll find
Oh, on my way

Such a waste I'm waiting out this time
Such a waste I'm feeling all of this now
So many ways to turn this all around
So many ways to make those hidden things found

There's something in the air

We're going through them changes
We're going through them changes babe...
You're going through them changes babe...
We're going through some changes
Hold my heart

It doesn't have a season especially not a fall
I'm giving you my all, mm
It doesn't need a reason to make sense at all
I'm giving you my all

Oh, my love cave into this space
Oh, my love cave into this space
Oh, my love cave into this space
Oh, my love cave into this...

I may die this way
Be careful how your mouth pulled apart
I can see your lips, I don't wanna feel your heart

Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth
Slowly lie to me
Like I need you to do so I can hear you say
Something that sounds right

Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth

Please be careful what you say
'Cause if I split in two you will be to blame
'Cause I know nothing better and nothing worse
And how you twist your letters into words

Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth
Slowly lie to me
Like I need you to do so I can hear you say
Something that sounds right

Slowly lie to me
Like I need you to do when you tell the truth
And tell me what to believe, and tell me what to deny
And whisper into my ear till everything dark turns bright

Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth
Slowly lie to me
Like I need you to do so I can hear you say
Something that sounds right`

Love must've got the best of me

With two people being young, having just a little fun

Wait, my train won't leave for a minute
No connection delays my departure from you
Hesitating, come fall at the doors if you feel it
'Cause we're running out of time, there's fine lines to be drawn

I see you smiling as you're talking on the phone
Hiding your messages, but I already know that
I'm not a part of your game

It ain't right what you're doing to me
It ain't right, you're confusing me
Which side of the fine lines do you want me?
It ain't right what you're doing to me
Can't you see you're confusing me?
Which side of the fine line's for you and me?

Calling coins will go, but you are still on my mind
Validate your intentions, you won't be fine
On the other hand, you're charging world
Maybe you'll move in single file
'Cause I'm losing my mind, there's fine lines to be drawn

And I believed me when I said that I would row
Snakes on the ladders, so I guess it's down we go
I've had enough of your games

It ain't right what you're doing to me
It ain't right, you're confusing me
Which side of the fine lines do you want me?
It ain't right what you're doing to me
Can't you see you're confusing me?
Which side of the fine line's for you and me?

The doors are closing, so is this our last goodbye?
Final curtain call before the whistle blows
Tells us why I've got to leave, I've got to go
I don't want to leave, don't want to go
But it's true 'cause we both know

It ain't right what you're doing to me
It ain't right, you're confusing me
Which side of the fine lines do you want me?
It ain't right what you're doing to me
Can't you see you're confusing me?

Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes
Now which is it?
I am sure of it

So, so you think you can tell
heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
Did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish
How I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here`

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh, (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Indochina: Capa jumps Jeep
Two feet creep up the road
To photo, to record, meat lumps and war
They advance as does his chance
Very yellow white flash!
A violent wrench grips mass
Rips light, tears limbs like rags
Burst so high, finally Capa lands
Mine is a watery pit
Painless with immense distance
From medic, from colleague, friend, enemy, foe
Him five yards from his leg
From you, Taro
Do not spray into eyes
I have sprayed you into my eyes

3:10 pm: Capa pends death
Quivers, last rattles, last chokes
All colours and cares glaze to grey
Shriveled and stricken to dots
The left hand grasps what the body grasps not
Le photographe est mort
3.1415, alive no longer my amour
Fated for home, May of ‘54
Doors open like arms, my love
Painless with a great closeness
To Capa, to Capa Capa dark after nothing
Reunited with his leg and with you, Taro
Taro
Do not spray into eyes
I have sprayed you into my eyes
