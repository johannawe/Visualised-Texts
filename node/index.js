	"songname": "Romeo and Juliet",
	"interpret": "Hobo Johnson",
	"lyrics": `It feels so good
Oh that's my shit right there
That's the ticket
Give me the ticket
Give it to me, baby
I'm too emotional
Good luck to my future wives
And their future lives without me
You guys will do great!
I'm sure that I've prepared you for every guy you'll date
And every guy you'll marry
And every guy you'll hate
It's the lullabies I sang out of tune
That's probably what did it
Or my twin size mattress that I had since I was seven
That we have to sleep on whenever she spends the night
And if she falls off again, she'll find another guy to like
We're just Romeo & Juliet
But getting drunk and eating Percocets
But just to ease the stress
But soft what light, through yonder window breaks
It is the east, but Juliet just puked off the balcony
How romantic
Nothing like getting drunk and getting manic
On a motherfucking Monday, I
I brush the bangs behind her lovely little ear
As she describes in detail how the end is truly near
Wow, and I'm sure that we can do this for forever
Or until we drink the poison, 'cause she sees some cloudy weather
As Rosaline, lies in bed, seething, wide awake
Because a burning love for Juliet only took a day
And if Romeo and Juliet continued to be married
Then there's half of a chance
That their kids would get embarrassed
When all the kids at school all talk about their parents
And Romeo Jr. has to say they're not together
And Junior will dream of the day when he's a man
And what he'll do to avoid that fifty percent chance
Of his kids feeling the way he feels
He'll probably just stick with the Netflix and chill
Dear Shakespeare
Could you write a happy ending please?
Could you write a happy ending please?
We just deserve a happy ending please, please
And every sting from every teardrop
From every ring at every pawn shop
I'm not missing both my Christmas'
Though family would be nice
In my dreams, my kids are happy
And I know that they won't mind
One Christmas
Just one Christmas
Just one Christmas
Just one Christmas
But dear mom
Conversations from a couch haven't ever felt the same
Since you looked Dad in the eye
And you told him that things are about to change
My mom was made from Adam's rib
And the marriage went south
When the snake came back and asked my mother out to dinner
And my dad found out, and asked my mom what that's about
And she said "Oh, it's nothing"
For dad loves to shout really loud
Loud enough to knock the lamps and dressers to the ground
In my memory, I can hear
Chopin's nocturnes playing in the background
A slow trainwreck, you'll close your eyes
But forever hear the sound, and boy, it's tough
'Cause that's the sound of people falling out of love

}
Say, can you hear?
Is there a meaning to your grief?
Where there is pain you see grace
As if sacrifice was meaningful and in itself
Your trial and error is error and error
Staying at the end of a hallway
Dozens of doors you never tried to open
Narrow vision, you're the scapegoat
Try to fix things that have never been
You're self-absorbed
Raving about your cryptic ways
Aren't willing to change
Old grudges
Hoping for your turn
All the basement stories you heard
Waiting for the world
To bend around you
Staying at the end of a hallway
Dozens of doors you never tried to open
Narrow vision, you're the scapegoat
Try to fix things that have never been
Waiting for the world to bend around you
Waiting for the world to bend around you
Waiting for the world to bend around you
Staying at the end of a hallway
Waiting for the world to bend around you
Dozens of doors you never tried to open
Waiting for the world to bend around you
Narrow vision, you're the scapegoat
Waiting for the world to bend around you
Try to fix things that have never been broken

Such a waste I'm waiting out this time
Such a waste I'm feeling all of this now
So many ways to turn this all around
So many ways to make those hidden things found

There's something in the air

We're going through them changes
We're going through them changes babe...
You're going through them changes babe...
We're going through some changes
Hold my heart

It doesn't have a season especially not a fall
I'm giving you my all, mm
It doesn't need a reason to make sense at all
I'm giving you my all

Be careful how your mouth pulled apart

Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth

Like I need you to do so I can hear you say
Something that sounds right

Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth

Please be careful what you say
'Cause if I split in two you will be to blame
'Cause I know nothing better and nothing worse
And how you twist your letters into words

Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth
Slowly lie to me
Like I need you to do so I can hear you say
Something that sounds right

Slowly lie to me
Like I need you to do when you tell the truth
And tell me what to believe, and tell me what to deny
And whisper into my ear till everything dark turns bright

	In a few weeks, I will get time to realise
It's right before my eyes
And I can take it if it's what I want to do
I am leaving and this is starting to feel like
It's right before my eyes
And I can taste it, it's my sweet beginning

And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

Maybe next year, I'll have no time
To think about the questions to address
Am I the one to try to stop the fire?
I wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you could have obtained
Why try anything? I will get there
Just remember, I know

And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time


And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

// Burst so high, finally Capa lands
// Mine is a watery pit
